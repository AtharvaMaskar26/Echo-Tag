## Introduction

Audio classification is the task of assigning a label to an audio sample from a set of predefined categories. This project uses deep learning techniques to automatically classify audio samples based on their features extracted using MFCC.

## Features

- Deep learning-based audio classification.
- Feature extraction using MFCC.
- Support for multiple audio formats (e.g., WAV, MP3).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Librosa
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
